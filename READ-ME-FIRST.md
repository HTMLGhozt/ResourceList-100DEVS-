# ResourceList-100DEVS-
A centralised lis of resources for and/or from the 100Devs.
************************************************************

Hello Fellow Devs,

I've been thinking of a way to keep track of all the awesome resources we are coming across in our time during the bootcamp.

I think a centralised list will help everyone as its a one stop shop and can be updated by anyone(as such please be mindful).

Please take the time to read the contribution guidelines set out in the other file aptly named contribution guide.

And please try to follow the following convention when adding a resource:

I have set up 4 files
- 1)HTML.md 
- 2)CSS.md 
- 3)JAVASCRIPT.md
- 4)OTHER.md

- try to add the resource to the file you think it best fits in.

- if you are adding a link please add a brief description as to what the link is for.

- try to ensure that you are not posting a duplicate resource.

- lastly seperate entries with a row of asterisks* to help keep it readable.



If anyone is willing to help maintain the resource list please feel free to let me know!

Happy Sharing!
